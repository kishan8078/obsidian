## Detection & Incident Response

- Write effective detection logic & use case development.
    
- Manage **alert triage**, tune to reduce false positives.
    
- Follow **NIST IR lifecycle** (Preparation → Containment → Eradication → Recovery → Lessons).
    
- Draft basic **playbooks** for common incidents.
