## **Basic Networking Concepts**

These test your understanding of fundamental networking principles:

1. **What is the OSI model? Explain each layer.**
    
    > Tests layered understanding of network communication.
    
2. **What is the difference between TCP and UDP?**
    
    > Tests protocol-level knowledge; TCP (reliable), UDP (faster, no guarantee).
    
3. **What is a port? What are some common port numbers?**
    
    > Examples: 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 22 (SSH), 53 (DNS)
    
4. **What is the difference between public and private IP addresses?**
    
5. **What is ARP? How does it work?**
    
    > Test knowledge of IP-to-MAC resolution in LAN.

**What is NAT? How does it work?**
    
**What is a subnet mask? Why is it important?**

## üß© **Security-Oriented Networking Questions**

Focus on threats, detections, and attack vectors:

1. **What is a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack?**
    
    > Can you explain how it works and how to detect/prevent it?
    
2. **What is DNS spoofing? How can you detect it?**
    
3. **What is the difference between a firewall and an IDS/IPS?**
    
4. **How can you detect port scanning on a network?**
    
    > Tools like Wireshark, Zeek, or Suricata might come up.
    
5. **What are some signs of a DDoS attack in network traffic?**
    
6. **What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption in secure communication?**

## üõ†Ô∏è **Tools and Protocols**

Testing practical and tool-level knowledge:

1. **What is Wireshark? What can you analyze with it?**
    
2. **What is the purpose of Netstat?**
    
3. **How would you analyze suspicious traffic on port 443?**
    
    > Even though it's encrypted, metadata can still be valuable.
    
4. **How does traceroute work? How can it be used in threat analysis?**
    
5. **What is PCAP? Have you worked with it?**

## üåê **Logs and Monitoring (SOC-Specific)**

Focus on what you'll actually do in a SOC:

1. **What kind of network logs do firewalls generate?**
    
2. **How do you differentiate between normal and abnormal traffic?**
    
3. **What would you look for in a PCAP file to find evidence of a malware infection?**
    
4. **What is the difference between an alert and an event in a SIEM tool?**

## üß† **Behavioral and Scenario-Based Questions**

1. **A user reports their machine is running slow. What network checks would you perform?**
    
2. **You see unusual outbound traffic to an unknown IP. What are your next steps?**
    
3. **How would you investigate a potential data exfiltration incident?**
